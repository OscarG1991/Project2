# ICARUS

An app where users login to store their favorite comic heroes and/or villains to their vault of saved characters. Once logged in, the user can post news blogs, view saved characters and add new characters.

*Future Development
A battle game where two on-screen characters fight each other, logging the users' battle statistics with wins & losses. The user's wins and losses will be viewed on their ```User Profile``` page and if they land in the top 10, their profile will be loaded to the ```Leaderboard```.*
